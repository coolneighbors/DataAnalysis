    "Originally, Spout was created with the unWISE-verse user interface in mind. As such, creating a Spout object was primarily meant to assist the user in creating subject sets in a specific project and uploading subjects to them through the UI. However, the Zooniverse data pipeline goes both ways. Not only can we upload subjects, we can retrieve them as well. As such, in addition to Spout's primary functionality, there exists static methods accessible via Spout which handle these retrevial and modifications of subjects.\n",
